# BLV_Cube_AT_Brush

Modifies the Armored Turtle brush found [here](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/AFC-Accessories/tree/main/AT_Brush) to work with the BLV Cube. Designed for [FilamATrix](https://github.com/thunderkeys/FilamATrix) with a dragon hotend. Uses [this](https://www.printables.com/model/414702-stealthburner-and-clockwork2-for-blv-cubes) to mount the stealthburner.

The changed STL's are provided as well as STEP.

You will need to replace the two M5x10 BHCS with M5x16 BHSC.
